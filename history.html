                    <p class="pps">The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) was established in 1992 as a government agency tasked with administering and developing the former
                        US naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines.<br>
                        The Subic Bay Freeport Zone was created in 1992 through the enactment of the Republic Act No. 7227 which designated the Subic Bay area as a special economic
                        and free port zone. SBMA was then created to oversee the administration and development of the free port, with the goal of transforming the former military
                        base into a hub for trade, commerce, and tourism.<br>
                        <br>
                        Since its establishment, SBMA has successfully attracted investments from various industries, including manufacturing, logistics, and tourism. The agency
                        has also implemented various infrastructure projects to support the growth of businesses and the local economy within the Freeport Zone.<br>
                        <br>
                        In recent years, SBMA has focused on promoting sustainable development and eco-tourism initiatives to further enhance the attractiveness of Subic Bay as a
                        premier destination for business and leisure. The authority continues to play a crucial role in driving economic growth and development in the region.
